						<Tab_1><![CDATA[<U>Unit Deployment Manager</U>: Maj Marks, you are being deployed with three members of your BE team to Woodruff AB located in County X. As you will recall, this base was originally occupied by the Soviets during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the base was abandoned. Two years ago, coalition forces set up the base to support EC-130s and AWACS aircraft. Since then, Navy and Marines have established camps on the base to support regional operations. Your transport will be leaving at 0700. You are being sent to conduct an assessment for a Congressional Inquiry. Your mission briefing will be provided once in route.]]></Tab_1>

A lot has changed since then. The base is now shared with other joint forces. They have each set up their main camps in different sectors of the base.

The most recent unit that has returned has been experiencing a number of health problems. After several trips to civilian doctors and no luck in finding the source of their illness, one of the SeaBees contacted their Congressman. The base Commander received notice several weeks ago of a pending Congressional Inquiry regarding the situation. Your team is here to conduct an assessment to determine what hazards, if any, are being posed to the SeaBee team and what exposures they may have received during previous rotations.<BR><BR><U>BE Team Lead, Maj Marks</U>: What is our timeline?<BR><BR><U>Intel Officer</U>: The time is currently 0600.

						<Tab_1><![CDATA[<U>Narrator</U>: After calling the USAFSAM Service Center with the isotope identification and airborne concentration of beta particles, they explained that for airborne beta particles you must compare your results to the derived air concentration (DAC) for each individual isotope. If your reading is less than the DAC, respiratory protection is not required. The Service Center confirms that your airborne concentration figure of 10,025 dpm/m&#179; is correct. The DAC for Cs-137 is 130,000. Based on the airborne concentration calculated, what level of respiratory protection is required?]]></Tab_1>
