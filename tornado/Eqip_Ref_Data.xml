		<discription><![CDATA[<li>Hand-held unit designed for both rugged and normal environments.</li><li>Uses a pressurized ionization chamber to quantify gamma and X-ray radiation (in Roentgens/hour or Sieverts/hour).</li><li>Can be used for monitoring soil, food, and water samples.</li><li>Measures energies between 20 KeV and 2 MeV, and has an operating range from 0 uR/h to 5 R/h. Most (but not all) radionuclides have a gamma or photon component as part of their decay scheme and will be detected by the 451P.</li><li>NOTE: The following nuclides either have too low a gamma energy or do not emit a gamma ray at all, and will not be detected by the 451P: H-3, C-14, Si-32, S-35, Fe-55, Ni-59, Ni-63, Tc-99, I-129, and Pm-147.</li>]]></discription>
